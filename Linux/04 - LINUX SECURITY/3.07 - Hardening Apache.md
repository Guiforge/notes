# LINUX Security 03 07 Hardening Apache

```bash
/etc/apache$N/conf-enabled/security.conf
```

1. Comment the line with `ServerTokens OS` and add `ServerTokens Prod` *(for product only)* in order to minimise the informations you'll give to the attacker. 
2. Replace `ServerSignature On` by `ServerSignature Off`
> This is simply going to say Apache and it's not even going to give the version number.

3. `TraceEnable On` to `TraceEnable Off`

Now go to `/etc/apache$N/sites-enabled/000-default.conf`, you can add :
```
<Directory /var/www/html>
    Options -Indexes
    Directory index.html main.html index.htm index.php
```
**This will turn off the directory listing when there's no index file.**

In `/etc/apache$N/mods-enabled/`, you can see you modules.

# LINUX Security 03 03 TCP Wrappers

A **TCP Wrapper** is a program that is designed to wrap a service program. 

You might use this for `telnet` or `ftp`, or maybe a potentially fragile service that doesn't have its own ability to manage wether somebody is going to be allowed to get access to it or not.

```bash
man tcpd
man hosts_access
cat /etc/hosts.deny # black-list
cat /etc/hosts.allow # white-list
```

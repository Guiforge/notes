# 02 01 The Boot Process

When you start a computer up, the first thing that happens is it runs a **power-on self-test** :
1. make sure that all of the internal hardware to the system is operating correctly
2. transfers control to the firmware that is going to look for a specific portion of the hard drive (*the Master Boot Record or the GUID partition table - associated with a DOS system*)

> Instead of using the **GR**and **U**nified **B**oot**L**oader or **GRUB**, you can use those boot loaders **LI**nux **LO**ader or **LILO**.

The point of the boot loader is to boot the OS from the hard disk. It does this by reading the first section of the hard drive. *Hmm `/dev/sda1` ?*

# 02 06 Runlevels

**runlevels** are ways of grouping services together, you specify a particular way of booting so you get specifically the services that you are looking for.

- `/etc/rc0.d` or **run level 0** : stopping the OS / shutting the machine down
- `/etc/rc1.d` : single user mode
- `/etc/rc1.d` : start adding additional services

`S*` => startup script => links for servics in `../init.d/`
`K*` => kill script

The order that they run in is actually ascii influenced (by the name).

`/etc/inittab` : config file for the init system

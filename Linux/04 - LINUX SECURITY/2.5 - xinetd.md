# 02 05 xinetd

One way to have network services on a Linux System is to make use of the Internet super server.

`inetd` or `xinetd` is the Internet super server process. 

The reason it's called the super server is because its one service that actually manages :
- a number of applications that sit behind it.
- all of the listening and communication and passes those communications off to the service program.

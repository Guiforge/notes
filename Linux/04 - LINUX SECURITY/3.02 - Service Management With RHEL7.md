# LINUX Security 03 02 Service Management With RHEL7

With **systemd** you can use `systemctl` to list all the services that are running in this particular system :

```bash
sudo systemctl restart $name.service
sudo systemctl stop $name.service
sudo systemctl status $name.service # much more detailed than init system
sudo systemctl is-enabled $name.service
sudo systemctl enable $name.service
sudo systemctl disable $name.service

```

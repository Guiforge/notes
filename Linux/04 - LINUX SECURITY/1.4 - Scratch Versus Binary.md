# Scratch Versus Binary

The disadvantage to binary based (Redhat, Ubuntu...) distros is that they determine what all of the dependencies that are going to be installed.

A distribution like Arch-Linux for example, does give you the ability to build your own packages depending on the dependencies an the specific subsystems and packages you want to install.

## Conclusion :
- Scratch version : more flexibility control and power
- Binary version : more easier to begin with

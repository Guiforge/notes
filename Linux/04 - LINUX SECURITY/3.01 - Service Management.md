# LINUX Security 03 01 Service Management

**service** : a programm that is started up in n and immediately goes to the background and just kind of runs there, waiting for requests.
> ***Examples**: web / ftp server, dbus (manages inter-process communication)...*

In most of Linux ditributions, you can manage services by doing :
```bash
sudo /etc/init.d/$service stop
sudo /etc/init.d/$service status
sudo /etc/init.d/$service star`
```

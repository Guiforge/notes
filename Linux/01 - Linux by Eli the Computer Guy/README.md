# Introduction 
Linux was created by Linus Torvalds between 1991 and 1994. Linux is not a version of Unix.

# Distributions 
Once Linux was released to the public numerous institutions created their own versions of the operating system. These different versions are called Distributions, or Distros. Different Distros have different functionality. 

# Open Source software is not necessarily free software 
Make sure you understand the licensing requirements for your Open Source software before you release it into a Production Environment. 

# Defining The Shell
The Shell is the interface you use to interact with the Operating System. Windows uses a GUI (Graphical User Interface) Shell, Linux primarily uses a LUI (Line User Interface) 

# ROOT 
ROOT is the highest level of anything in the Linux world. ROOT user is the highest level user. The ROOT directory s the highest level directory. 

# Capitalization
Capitalization matters in Linux (HOME is different then home) 

# Server vs. Desktop Versions 
Server versions of Linux install the bare minimum number of components for the system to function. After installation you will be faced with a blinking cursor. Desktop versions of Linux come prepackaged with a GUI environment and numerous tools and applications. After installation you will be presented with an environment that looks a lot like Windows or the Mac OS.

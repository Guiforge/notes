> Every programing language follow **R.D.Tennent principles**: (1) Abstraction (2) Correspondence, (3) Data Type Completeness

Sheer volume of information in IT so we cannot learn everything, so we have to develop our **research methodology** and our **learning process**.

Have to learn how to find, choose, and adapt the information you need.

Experience is built on failures, `mistakes are an essential part of the learning process`.

We all started with zero knowledge!

Passive Learning vs Active Learning

> **Tip**: Before creating documentation for your audience, you can clarify which points are most important to them.

**Progress is noticeable when the question that tortured us has lost its meaning.**

Recommended tools:
- `CherryTree`
- `FlameShot`

**Focus** and **attention** are not the same!

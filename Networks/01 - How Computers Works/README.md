## [What makes a computer a computer ?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mCq8-xTH7jA&list=PLzdnOPI1iJNcsRwJhvksEo1tJqjIqWbN-&index=2)

The **4 things** common to all computers :

**1.** Take **Input** (from your keyboard, mouse, webcam, microphone, touchscreen...)

**2.** **Store informations** as data

**3.** **Process it**

**4.** **Output** the results

When a computers connect over the Internet, the output from one computer becomes the input to another, and vice versa.

## [Binary & Data](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=USCBCmwMCDA&index=3&list=PLzdnOPI1iJNcsRwJhvksEo1tJqjIqWbN-)

Computers works with **1** and **0**. 

Nowadays, almost nobody deals directly with **1** and **0**.

**Ones** and **Zeroes** do play a big role in *how computers work* on the inside.

Inside computers are electric wires and circuits that carry all the information.

### ... *But how do you store or represent information using electricity ?*

If a we take **a single wire** with **electricity flowing through it**, the **signal** can be **ON** or **OFF**, **YES** or **NO**, **TRUE** or **FALSE**, **1** or **0**. Anything else with only two options.

This state is called a **BIT** and it's **the smallest piece of information a computer can store**.

**More wires** you have, **more bits** you can store ! And with more bits, you can represent more complex information.

With 8 wires, you can store numbers from 0 to 255. With just 32 wires, you can store all the way from 0 to 4 billions.

### ... *But what about Text, Images or Sound ?*

All these can be represented by numbers

- `Text in binary` : You can assign a number to each letter. Every works can be a sequence of numbers.
- `Images in binary` : Photos, Videos, Graphics are made of teeny dots called **pixels**. 

Each pixels has a color. Each of the colors can be represented with numbers (**r**ed, **g**reen, **b**lue combinations).

A **typical Imag**e has **millions of these pixels**, and a **typical video** shows **30 images per second** so more than **3 billion of pixels per minute**.

- `Sound in binary` : Every sound is basically a series of vibrations in the air. 

Vibrations can be represented graphically as a waveform. 

Any point on this waveform can be represented by a number. And this way, any sound can be broken down into a series of numbers.

## [Circuits and Logic](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZoqMiFKspAA&list=PLzdnOPI1iJNcsRwJhvksEo1tJqjIqWbN-&index=4)

Today computer circuits are microscopic in size, and way way faster. Smaller compters are also fasters because the smaller circuit is, the less distance the electrical signal has to go.

**Electricty** moves at just about **the speed of light** which is why modern circuits can perform billions of calculations per second.

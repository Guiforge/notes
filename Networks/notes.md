# PCAP

Notes from [PCAP Analysis](http://maki.bzh/articles/wiresharkhowtobasic/).

PCAP file contain data from 2nd to 7th layer in OSI model.

Usage: identify malicious traffic, track a threat, identifies rogue DHCP servers, monitors intrusions...

## Tools: 

- **Wireshark-qt (GUI) / tshark (command line)**: analysis and capture tool

```bash
tshark -r filename.pcap -Y display_filter -Tfields -e some_specific_filter
# Example: tshark -r OtterLeak.pcap -Y 'smb && data.data' -Tfields -e data.data
```

- **CapAnalysis**: statistical analysis such as counting the number of requests per IP, listing protocols used over time and so on.
- **Binwalk**: reverse engineering tool &rarr; extracting firmware images. Detect some file patten inside another.

```bash
binwalk -e filetransfer.pcapng
```

**Foremost** is similar to **Binwalk**.

- **Scripting languages (ex: Python _(pyshark, scapy...)_ / Bash)**

# [TCPDUMP](https://www.tcpdump.org/)

`tcpdump` works exactly like **Wireshark**, except that it is the <u>command line</u> for Linux machines.

> `windump` is a similar program for Windows users (except Windows 10 ?).

**TCPdump** will print out a description of all the contents of all the packets that is capturing preceded by a timestamp _(save the data into a file, capture a specific amount of packets...)_.

Some options:
- `-D`: list available network interfaces.
- `-i <interface | number>`: capture the traffic of a specific interface.
- `-n`: don't convert addresses to names.
- `-A`: print packet to ASCII.
- `-c`:Exit after receiving count packets.
- `<PROTOCOL>`: filter by protocol.
- `dst|src <ip>`: filter by destination|source.
- `-t` : delete all timestamps.
- `-tttt` : time + date.
- `-x`: print in hex (with link level headers type `-xx`).
- `-X`: print ASCII + hex (with link level headers type `-Xx`).

> **link level headers**: include OS layer 2 information like MAC addresses.

Genrally outputs look like:

```
<time(h,m,s,ms)> <protocol> (<port>) <packet information> 
```

# TSHARK

## Capturing Packets & Promiscuous mode

> It is not recommended to run `tshark` or **Wireshark** as root because it may end up having some kind of parsing overflow vulnerability, and an attacker would be able to remotely compromised your system by exploiting it.

To change config type `dpkg-reconfigure wireshark-common`.

- `-D`: list available network interfaces.
- `-i <interface | number | any>`: capture the traffic of a specific interface.

> Default behavior of any interface is accept unicast _(destined for it)_, broadcast and chose multicast packets.

> **Promiscuous mode** &rarr; accept all received packets regardless of whether it is destined for you or not.

> **Monitor mode**: applies to 802.11 (Wi-Fi cards & interfaces) only

## Writing and exporting Packet Data

- `-T ek|fields|json|pdml|ps|psml|tabs|text`: set the format of the output when viewing decoded packet data.

> `ek` &rarr; Elastic search

In `/usr/share/wireshark/`, there is a `pdml2html.xsl` file... :smirk: :

`xsltproc /usr/share/wireshark/pdml2html.xsl <your_pdml_file>`

## Capture Filter â‰  Display Filter

**BPF** stands for (**B**erkeley **P**acket **F**ilter).

[pcap filter](https://wireshark.org/man-pages/pcap-filter.html)

- `-f` : filters

### Display Filters

Appliyed to alreday <u>captured packets</u>.

- Allow to view a subsection of the captured packets based on a filter expression
- Helps in zeroing down on interesting packets
- Display and Capture filters have different syntax
- Display filter expression are more granular

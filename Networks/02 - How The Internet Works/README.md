In the early 70s, **Vint Cerf** and **Bob Kahn** work on the design of what we called the Internet.

It was a result of another experiment called the **ARPANET** *which stood for **A**dvanced **R**esearch **P**roject **A**gency **N**etwork*.

The **Internet** is made up of an incredibly large number of independently operated networks. 

The utility of the net is that any device can communicate with any other device and move information.

> What's interesting about the system is that it's fully distributed. There's no central control that is deciding how packets are routed or where pieces of the network are built or even who interconnects with whom. These are all business decisions that are made independently by the operators.

Thereby, **anybody** and **everybody** are in charge of the Internet.

### How does a picture, text message or email gets sent from one place to another ?

The **Internet** is a lot like the **postal service** !

However, instead of boxes and envelopes the Internet **ships binary information**.

**Information is made of bits** *like we saw in* [How Computers works ?](https://github.com/kecro/notes/tree/master/Networks/01%20-%20How%20Computers%20Works#how-computers-work-).

```
8 bits = 1 byte
1024 bytes = 1 Ko (kilobyte)
1024 kilobytes = 1 Mo (megabyte)
```

Today we **physically send bits** by **electricty, light and radio waves**.

#### *... how can we send five zeros in a row ?*

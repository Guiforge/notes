In the early 70s, **Vint Cerf** and **Bob Kahn** work on the design of what we called the Internet.

It was a result of another experiment called the **ARPANET** *which stood for **A**dvanced **R**esearch **P**roject **A**gency **N**etwork*.

The **Internet** is made up of an incredibly large number of independently operated networks. 

The utility of the net is that any device can communicate with any other device.

> What's interesting about the system is that it's fully distributed. There's no central control that is deciding how packets are routed or where pieces of the network are built or even who interconnects with whom. These are all business decisions that are made independently by the operators.

Thereby, **anybody** and **everybody** are in charge of the Internet.

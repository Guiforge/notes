# Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs)

**Key idea:** look at the brain architecture for inspiration on how to build an intelligent machine.

**ANNs are at the very core of Deep Learning.**

First **introduced in 1943** by the neurophysiologist **Warren McCulloh** and the mathematician **Walter Pitts** in their paper: [_"A logical calculus of ideas immanent in nervous activity"_](https://scholar.google.com/scholar?q=A+Logical+Calculus+of+Ideas+Immanent+in+Nervous+Activity+author%3Amcculloch).

There are a few good reasons to think that the current wave of interest in ANNs will not face an [AI winter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AI_winter):

- Huge quantity of data available for training.

- Computing power has tremendously increase _(since the 1990's)_ &rarr; so we can train ANNs in a reasonable amount of time.

- Training algorithms have been improved.

- Many popular products are now based on ANNs which pulls more and more attention and funding toward them, resulting in more and more progress, and even more amazing products.
